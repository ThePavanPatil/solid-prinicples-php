# Examples of SOLID principles in PHP


1) S - Single Responsibility Principle - A Class should be responsible for a single task.

2) O - Open/Closed Principle - A Class should be open to extension and close to modification.

3) L - Liskov Substitution Principle - A derived Class can be substituted at places where base Class is used.

4) I - Interface Segregation Principle - Don’t make FAT Interfaces. i.e. Classes don’t have to override extra agreements that are not needed for that Class simply because it is there in interface.

5) D - Dependency Inversion Principle -  Depend on abstractions, not on concretions. Not only high level Classes but low level Classes also depend on the abstractions in order to decouple the code.
